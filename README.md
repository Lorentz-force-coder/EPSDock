# EPSDock:

The code for paper "The development of EPSDock, a new docking suite based on enhanced particle swarm optimization algorithm and its assessment on RNA-ligand benchmark sets".
EPSDock is a novel docking tools for RNA and Small molecules interaction evaluation. The resource code shown as EPSDock-code.rar files. You can download and compile it by gcc,g++ on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS OS. ​​Furthermore, a compiled version of the EPSDock is available. e.g. epsdock. ​​If you encounter problems during compilation, you can use the compiled program directly.​

# Case Study:
Here, we describle two RNA situation docking results :

PDB Code: 1EHT and 2F4T

Compare Tools: AutoDOck4; Vina; rDock; GlideSP; FIPSDock;

Docking poses and Docking RMSD as follows:

For 1EHT RNA site--
